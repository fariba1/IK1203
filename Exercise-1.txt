1.
    a) Protocols define 'format and order' of 'messages sent and 
    recieved' among network entities, and 'actions taken' on 
    message transmission and reception.

    b)  - application layer
            HTTP, FTP
        - transport layer
            TCP, UDP
        - network layer
            IP, Routing
        - link layer
            Ethernet, IEEE 802.11 WLAN
        - physical layer
            Bit coding, TP cat 6

    c) link layer

    d)  routing: determines source-destination route taken by 
        packets
        
        forwarding: move packets from router's input to appropriate 
        out link

    e) Provides communication between application processes on 
    different hosts

2.  1) UA, of the sender, sends message to it's outgoing mail server where
    it's placed in a message queue.

    2) The client side of SMTP, the outgoing mail server, opens a 
    TCP connection with the server side of SMTP, the incoming mail server
    of the reciever.

    3) The SMTP client sends the queued message over the TCP connection.

    4) The incoming server places the message in the reciever UA,
    recievers mailbox.

3.  a) TCP on port 25

    b) T = 2.5ms * (7 + (antal rader i meddelande + 1))

    c) T = 2.5ms * ((7 +(3*2)) + (antal rader i meddelande + 1))

4.  No. Before sending a line of mail text, the SMTP client checks the 
    first character of the line. If it is a period, one additional period
    is inserted at the beginning of the line.

5.  a) http://www.kth.se/
    
    b) 200 OK, yes it was successful

    c) 60044

    d) HTTP keep-alive, a.k.a., HTTP persistent connection, is an 
    instruction that allows a single TCP connection to remain open 
    for multiple HTTP requests/responses.
    Enabling the keep-alive header allows you to serve all web
    page resources over a single connection. Keep-alive also reduces 
    both CPU and memory usage on your server.

    The server uses the Connection: close
    header line to tell the client that it is going to close the TCP 
    connection after sending the message.

    e) <html

6.  a) Tit-for-tat is the incentive mechanism and works as follows:
        Priority is given to the neighbors that currently is supplying
        the highest data rate.

        The 4 neighbors which is feeding the most data will be unchoked
        and other neighbors will be choked i.e that neighbor will not be 
        supplied data.

        Also, every 30 seconds a new neighbor is optimistically unchoked
        so that the new neighbor can supply its data rate and if it is
        higher than the top 4 is will take the lowest-rate suppliers spot.

    b) The rarest chunk is a chunk of data that is determined by the peers
    by comparing the chunks they have. The chunk that the fewest peers
    have is the rarest chunk and will be prioritised to be shared first.

    This is to try and get that chunk distrubuted quicker and to try to
    reach a equilibrium of the data chunks amongst the 
    peers so that if the peer/peers that have the rarest chunk dont 
    disconnects and the chunk is unreachable by the online users.

    The two advantages are:
    1. quicker desttribution of that chunk
    2. making sure that the rarest chunks will be obtainable in the 
       network.

7.  a) 
        1. Requesting host asks the local DNS server for punchy.fws.com
        2. Either the local DNS server has punchy.fws.com in cache
        and can provide it OR the local DNS server will ask the root 
        DNS server.
        3. The root DNS server only has the IP:s to the TLD DNS servers.
        And will answer with the address to the .com TLD DNS server.
        4. The local DNS server will query the .com TLD DNS server  
        for the address to punchy.fws.com.
        5. TLD DNS server for .com does not have punchy.fws.com stored 
        and will answer the query with the IP-address to fws.com.
        6. The local DNS server querys thefws.com authorative DNS server 
        for punchy.fws.com.
        7. The authorative DNS server for fws.com will answer the query 
        with the IP to punchy.fws.com.
        8. The local DNS server will store punchy.fws.com in cache and 
        answer the requesting host with the IP address to punchy.fws.com.

    b)  - The querys from the local DNS server is recursive
        - Querys at the root/TLD/authorative DNS servers is iterative

    c)  Yes, the IP-address is the same in the different RR.

    d)  400 - Bad Request

8.  IP version 4 address for “www.kth.se”           type=A
    IP version 6 address for “www.kth.se”           type=AAAA
    TCP port number for HTTP server at “www.kth.se” type=SRV
    Incoming mail server for “kth.se”               type=A
    Outgoing mail server for “kth.se”               type=MX
    Authoritative name server for “kth.se”          type=NS
    Web server for “kth.se”                         type=A
    Main (canonical) name for alias “www.kth.se”    type=CNAME
    Host name with address “130.237.28.40”          type=PTR
    
P2  D_end-end - end to end delay
    L          - length
    N          - number of links
    R          - transmission rate
    

    D_end-end=N*L/R     - of sending one packet
    
    (N+(P-1))(L/R)
    
P6
    T = N*T_t + N*T_p + (N-1)*T_r
    a)  T_p = d/s
    b)  T_t = L/R
    c)  T = N*T_t + N*T_p where (N-1)*T_r is ignored
    d)  It's at A. Just about to be sent from host A/on the link
    e)  On the link
    f)  It's at host B
    g)  L/R = m/s -> d = m(L/R) => 536km
